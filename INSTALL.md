## Detailed Install Instructions

Operating system specific install instructions are located in:

* doc/INSTALL-LINUX.md
* doc/INSTALL-MAC.md
* doc/INSTALL-WINDOWS.md

## Getting Started

The best way to get started with libopenshot-audio, is to learn about our build system, obtain all the source code, 
install a development IDE and tools, and better understand our dependencies. So, please read through the 
following sections, and follow the instructions. And keep in mind, that your computer is likely different 
than the one used when writing these instructions. Your file paths and versions of applications might be 
slightly different, so keep an eye out for subtle file path differences in the commands you type.

## Build Tools

CMake is the backbone of our build system.  It is a cross-platform build system, which checks for dependencies, 
locates header files and libraries, generates makefiles, and supports the cross-platform compiling of 
libopenshot and libopenshot-audio.  CMake uses an out-of-source build concept, where all temporary build 
files, such as makefiles, object files, and even the final binaries, are created outside of the source 
code folder, inside a /build/ sub-folder.  This prevents the build process from cluttering up the source 
code.  These instructions have only been tested with the GNU compiler (including MSYS2/MinGW for Windows).

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to build libopenshot-audio.  Instructions on how to install these 
dependencies vary for each operating system.  Libraries and Executables have been labeled in the 
list below to help distinguish between them.

* ### CMake (cmake)
  * http://www.cmake.org/ `(Executable)`
  * This executable is used to automate the generation of Makefiles, check for dependencies, and is the backbone of libopenshot-audioâ€™s cross-platform build process.

* ### Doxygen (doxygen)
  * http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ `(Executable)`
  * This executable is used to auto-generate the documentation used by libopenshot-audio.

* ### OpenMP (-fopenmp)
  * http://openmp.org/wp/ `(Compiler Flag)`
  * If your compiler supports this flag (GCC, Clang, and most other compilers), it provides libopenshot-audio with easy methods of using parallel programming techniques to improve performance and take advantage of multi-core processors.

## Obtaining Source Code

The first step in installing libopenshot-audio is to obtain the most recent source code. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot-audio). Use the following command to obtain the latest libopenshot-audio source code.

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenShot/libopenshot-audio.git
```

## Linux Build Instructions (libopenshot-audio)
To compile libopenshot-audio, we need to go through a few additional steps to manually build and install it. Launch a terminal and enter:

```
cd [libopenshot-audio repo folder]
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
make install
./src/openshot-audio-test-sound  (This should play a test sound)
```
